# OP-Stack Development Network

This repository contains instructions and scripts to run your own development blockchain based on [OP-Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/).

The blockchain will be operated on a network consisting of one or more nodes, serving as a layer 2 (L2) solution backed by another blockchain, which acts as layer 1 (L1).

The instructions provided in this repository draw heavily from the [OP-Stack Getting Started Guide](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/build/getting-started/). However, we have included several tips based on our practical experience and solutions to found issues.
